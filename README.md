Hello! I'm Sadisu Mohammed, a Software Engineer making a dedicated transition into the field of Cybersecurity. My fascination with how systems are designed and scaled has naturally evolved into a passion for securing them. I believe that building secure systems starts at the code level, and my background in backend development with Java and Spring Boot provides me with a unique perspective on application security and the secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC).

My journey into cybersecurity is not just an interest; it's an active pursuit. I have built a strong foundation through the Cisco Introduction to Cybersecurity certification and have gained practical, hands-on experience through immersive job simulations, including the Cybersecurity Analyst Job Simulation and the intensive Deloitte Cyber Simulation. These experiences have allowed me to apply my analytical skills to real-world scenarios, such as web activity incident investigation and log analysis, which you can find documented in my GitHub portfolio.

Currently, I am channeling my focus into two key areas of cybersecurity:

üõ°Ô∏è {Defensive Security (Blue Team)} I am actively developing my skills in security operations (SecOps), incident response, and threat detection. I am building and expanding my home lab to practice with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and SIEM platforms, and I am passionate about the process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating threats.

‚öîÔ∏è {Offensive Security (Red Team)} To be a great defender, one must understand the attacker's mindset. I am also exploring penetration testing methodologies, learning how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled and ethical manner. This dual perspective allows me to approach security challenges with a more holistic and effective strategy.

I am eager to bring my software engineering background, my passion for problem-solving, and my growing cybersecurity expertise to an entry-level cybersecurity analyst role. I am a dedicated and fast learner, committed to continuous growth in this ever-evolving field.

Feel free to explore my projects on GitHub, and let's connect! I'm always open to discussing cybersecurity, sharing knowledge, and exploring opportunities to contribute to a security-conscious organization.
