# Hi there, I'm Sadisu Mohammed! üëã

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in backend systems development, now making a dedicated transition into the dynamic field of Cybersecurity. My passion for building robust and optimized systems has evolved into a deep commitment to securing them against evolving threats. I believe my unique blend of development expertise and a proactive security mindset allows me to approach cybersecurity challenges from a comprehensive perspective.

My journey into cybersecurity is driven by hands-on learning and practical application. I've gained valuable experience through:

üõ°Ô∏è {Cybersecurity Certifications}: Including Cisco Introduction to Cybersecurity, Cyber Job Simulation, and Cybersecurity Analyst Job Simulation.


‚öîÔ∏è {Intensive Simulations}: Actively participated in the Deloitte Cyber Simulation, where I gained practical experience in web activity incident investigation and log analysis.


üíª {Hands-on Labs & Projects}: Continuously building and experimenting in my home lab, focusing on both offensive (penetration testing) and defensive (security operations, incident response) security techniques. My GitHub repositories reflect this journey.

{My Focus Areas}

{}   Secure Software Development:Leveraging my background in Java and Spring Boot to understand and implement security best practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SSDLC).

{}   Security Operations (SecOps): Deep diving into threat detection, incident response, log analysis, and security monitoring.

{}   Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing:** Exploring methodologies and tools to identify and ethically exploit system weaknesses.

{}   Network & System Security: Building on foundational knowledge to secure complex network infrastructures and operating systems.
