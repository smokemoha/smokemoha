# 👋 Hi, I'm Sadisu Mohammed  

## 🚀 SOC Enthusiast & Threat Hunting Enthusiast in Training  

I’m on a mission to **detect, understand, and neutralize cyber threats** before they cause harm.  
My journey started in **software engineering (Java + Spring Boot)**, but my passion for protecting systems led me into **cybersecurity**.

### 🛡️ What I Do
- 🧠 **SOC & Log Analysis** – Investigate suspicious activity, correlate logs, and respond to incidents.  
- 🔍 **Threat Hunting** – Proactively search for attacker activity using SIEMs and network data.  
- 🛠 **Hands-On Labs** – Occasional practice on TryHackMe, Elastic SIEM, and custom home lab setups.
