Hello! I'm Sadisu Mohammed, a Software Engineer specializing in backend systems development with a keen interest in industrial automation. My work is driven by a fascination with how systems are designed, scaled, and optimized for real-world problem-solving.

I approach programming as a tool for creating structured, efficient, and elegant solutions. My focus lies primarily in backend development using {Java and Spring Boot}; where I strive to build robust and scalable applications. My GitHub repositories reflect this journey, showcasing projects in backend development alongside explorations into Python scripting and other technologies.

Currently:

{}   ðŸ”­ Deepening my expertise in **Java and Spring Boot** through dedicated projects and continuous learning, focusing on building production-ready backend services.
{}   ðŸŒ± Exploring the potential of emerging technologies like {Heavy Machine Automation}, AI/ML, and Blockchain, seeking to understand their practical applications and impact.

Collaboration:

{}   ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that demand technical rigor and foster shared learning, particularly those involving complex backend challenges or innovative automation solutions.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect if you share similar interests or see potential for collaboration.
