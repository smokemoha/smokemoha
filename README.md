ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Sadisu Mohammed a software engineer guided by curiosity, shaped by discipline, and driven by an enduring fascination with how systems think, scale, and evolve.

I see programming not as a task, but as a language of structure and possibility an instrument for solving real problems through elegant, intentional design. My GitHub is a living archive of this exploration: from foundational backend applications in Java and Spring Boot, to experimental forays into Python scripting, Node.js, and cross-platform mobile development.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving my backend development skills, especially in Java and Spring Boot, through self-driven projects and continuous learning.

ðŸŒ± My curiosity extends into emerging domains such as Blockchain, AI/ML, and Android automationâ€”fields I approach not for trendâ€™s sake, but for their potential to reshape interaction, and intelligence.

ðŸ‘¯ I value collaboration that embraces both technical rigor and creative discourseâ€”projects that challenge assumptions, encourage shared learning, and invite deeper engagement with the craft.
